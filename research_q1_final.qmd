# appending the two data sets

# exclude outlier(one observation with 0 cm reach)

# Log-transform the variables

ufc_q1$LogReachCms <- log(ufc_q1$ReachCms)
model_q1 <- lm(AvgSigStrLanded ~ ReachCms + WeightClass + Height + WinStreak, 
               data = ufc_q1)
summary(model_q1)
```

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(car)          # For VIF
library(ggplot2)      # For residual plots

# 1. Check Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for collinearity
vif_values <- vif(model_q1)
print("Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):")
print(vif_values)

# 2. Residuals vs Fitted Plot for Linearity
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(2, 2, 2, 2))  # Set plotting layout
plot(model_q1)

# 3. Normal Q-Q Plot for Normality of Residuals
qqnorm(residuals(model_q1))
qqline(residuals(model_q1))

# 4. Scale-Location Plot for Homoscedasticity
plot(model_q1, which = 3)

# 5. Check for influential points using Cook's Distance
cooksd <- cooks.distance(model_q1)
plot(cooksd, type = "h", main = "Cook's Distance", ylab = "Cook's Distance")

# Highlight observations with Cook's Distance > threshold
threshold <- 4 / nrow(ufc_clean)
influential <- which(cooksd > threshold)
abline(h = threshold, col = "red", lty = 2)
text(x = influential, y = cooksd[influential], labels = names(cooksd[influential]), pos = 4)

# 6. R-squared value
r_squared <- summary(model_q1)$r.squared
cat("R-squared:", r_squared, "\n")
```

Linearity assumption is not being met as the residuals show a curved pattern or non-linearity.

Polynomial does not work

Removing influential points

### OPTION: REMOVING INFLUENTIAL POINTS AND TAKING LOG

```{r}
cooks_d <- cooks.distance(model_q1)
influential <- which(cooks_d > (4 / nrow(ufc_q1)))
ufc_q1_clean <- ufc_q1[-influential, ]

model_clean <- lm(AvgSigStrLanded ~ LogReachCms + WeightClass + log(Height) + WinStreak, data = ufc_q1_clean)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(model_clean)
```

This proved somewhat helpful.

Linearity is still an issue.

Addressing the high VIF in the original model:

```{r}
model_simple <- lm(LogAvgSigStrLanded ~ LogReachCms + WeightClass + log(Height) + WinStreak, data = ufc_q1)
vif(model_simple)
```

```{r}
vif(model_clean)
```

### OPTION : INTERACTION TERM

```{r}
model_clean_int <- lm(AvgSigStrLanded ~ LogReachCms + WinStreak * WeightClass + log(Height), data = ufc_q1_clean)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(model_clean_int)

vif(model_clean_int)
```

### OPTION: INTERACTION TERM WITH THE OG DATA

```{r}
model_int <- lm(AvgSigStrLanded ~ LogReachCms + WinStreak * WeightClass + log(Height), data = ufc_q1)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(model_clean_int)

vif(model_int)
```
