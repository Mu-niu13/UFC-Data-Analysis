Linearity assumption being violated

Equal variance assumption being violated

Checking the distributions of the outcome and predictor variables

```{r}
# outcome variable
boxplot(filtered_ufc$AvgSigStrLanded, 
        main = "Boxplot of AvgSigStrLanded", 
        ylab = "AvgSigStrLanded",
        col = "lightblue")
```

```{r}
boxplot(filtered_ufc$ReachCms, 
        main = "Boxplot of ReachCms", 
        ylab = "ReachCms",
        col = "lightgreen")
```

```{r}
boxplot(AvgSigStrLanded ~ WeightClass, 
        data = filtered_ufc, 
        main = "Boxplot of AvgSigStrLanded by Weight Class", 
        xlab = "Weight Class", 
        ylab = "AvgSigStrLanded",
        col = "pink",
        las = 2) # Rotate x-axis labels for readability
```

Log transforming all the variables and checking the distribution

```{r}
# Log-transform the variables
filtered_ufc$LogAvgSigStrLanded <- log(filtered_ufc$AvgSigStrLanded)
filtered_ufc$LogReachCms <- log(filtered_ufc$ReachCms)

# Boxplot for log-transformed AvgSigStrLanded
boxplot(filtered_ufc$LogAvgSigStrLanded, 
        main = "Boxplot of Log(AvgSigStrLanded)", 
        ylab = "Log(AvgSigStrLanded)",
        col = "orange")

```

```{r}
# Boxplot for log-transformed ReachCms
boxplot(filtered_ufc$LogReachCms, 
        main = "Boxplot of Log(ReachCms)", 
        ylab = "Log(ReachCms)",
        col = "purple")
```

```{r}
model_log <- lm(LogAvgSigStrLanded ~ LogReachCms * WeightClass, data = filtered_ufc)
summary(model_log)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(2, 2, 2, 2)) 
plot(model_log)
